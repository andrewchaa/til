# CODEOWNERS

You can use a [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners) file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

```
# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# all users listed here will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
