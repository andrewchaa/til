# Auto-generate README for TIL

There's a post on Hackernews about [self-rewriting README](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/). A few days later, [a github action](https://github.com/cflynn07/github-action-til-autoformat-readme) that does it appeared.
So, I revived my dead til repo and applied the github action.
