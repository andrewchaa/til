# Writing Azure function app with Rider

By default, [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) doesn't have the template for Azure function.

Go to Settings > Plugins and install "Azure Tookit for Rider"

Then go to Settings > Tools and install the latest version of `Azure Functions Core Tool`

Now you are ready to create a Function app project.
