# Ephmeral certificate

"Ephemeral" means lasting for a very short time

> Ephemeral certificates are short-lived access credentials that are valid for as long as they are required to authenticate and authorize privileged connections. In an authorization mechanism based on ephemeral certificates, the critical target systems are accessed without using permanent access credentials, explicit access revocation or traditional key management.

What's the benefit? It's more secuire, in short.

> Ephemeral certificates are a more secure solution than permanent access credentials because of their ephemeral nature. They automatically expire, usually within a few minutes, which reduces the burden for managing credentials which are no longer required. In addition, security teams do not have to worry about revoking those credentials if the users rotate and their roles change.
